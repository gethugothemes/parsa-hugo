Jess and Caoimhe met in 2015 at the start of their PhDs in mathematics at the University of Oxford. As advocates for making mathematics accessible, and promoting its many applications to people of all ages, genders, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, they founded _Mathematigals_: an organization to foster diversity among physical scientists.

Recent decades have seen a welcome increase in the participation of women in science worldwide. However, the physical sciences still lags behind in closing the gender gap:researchers inthe fields of Computer Science, Energy, Engineering, Mathematics, and Physics & Astronomy,are comprised ofless than 25% women (Elsevierreport, 2017). The aims of _Mathematigals_ are two-fold:

1. Striving to fully understand why this gender discrepancy persists within the physical sciences through podcasts and written discourse with influencing parties from researchers and university staff to parents and early-stage teachers.
2. Increasing societal awareness of mathematical applications through informative blog posts and by disseminating short, palatable 3-minute videos describing specific applications. We willaim these primarily at school-aged children with the hope that they will be shared by educators and parents. We believe that by improving the accessibility of mathematics, we will also combat the gender gap.
